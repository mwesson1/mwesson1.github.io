    	<p>"Julianne was my coach at various levels for more than 5 years, and I can honestly say that she was one of the biggest factors in helping me pursue my college soccer career. Not only did I benefit tremendously form our induvial skills sessions, but Julianne also coached me through the more personal aspects that come with playing a sport- everything from navigating team relationships to holding myself accountable for my health and fitness off the field to helping me decide what I wanted my college career to look like. Julianne’s investment in me is a big part of the reason why I am where I am today, and I can’t recommend (or thank) her more profusely."</p>&ensp;

A winner as a player collegiately, professionally and in our national program, she has brought this intensity, experience and know how to our program. Her leadership skills, mentoring ability and motivational style have been incredibly impactful for the women on our team both on and off the field. We are incredibly fortunate to have Julianne on our staff and are super excited that she is creating this incredible opportunity for others to experience the impact she can have in elevating the level of play and more importantly the level of confidence, motivation and self-esteem of young girls through her camp."</p>&ensp;

    	<p>"As a coach and trainer, Julianne is one of the most motivational, inspirational, and dedicated I have ever met or worked with. As a former collegiate and professional athlete, myself, she has been instrumental in pushing me to achieve my goals physically and competitively with a training plan and the motivation needed to succeed. I can always count on Julianne to come through with a program that works for me, and the inspiration to keep me going in my training…even when I don’t want to.

Julianne has also been the best coach for my daughter throughout her high school soccer career, and now into her collegiate athletics. My daughter asks for Julianne in her off-season, knowing she will push her to grow in her speed and agility, as well as ball skills and physical fitness. Julianne knows what it takes to train and prepare for the highest levels of competition, and gives her best to her players while expecting the best from them in return. Her dedication and care, coupled with the expertise she brings following her professional soccer career is unmatched amongst her peers."</p>&ensp;

Over the years, my kids have worked with several terrific coaches and trainers yet they enjoy training with Julianne the most!"</p>&ensp;

    	<p>"I first met Julianne when I was 14. I enrolled in her summer fitness camp, which was three hours a week for five weeks. Every workout we did was extremely efficient. We never did the same exercise twice, and it was always fun. I ended up dropping six seconds off one of my fitness tests in just fifteen sessions because of Julianne’s help. Since then, I have worked with Julianne in soccer and fitness settings. I looked forward to practice days every week because of the energy she brought to my team. She always pushed my teammates and I to be the best people we can be, and somehow got our group of 16-year-old girls to want to work harder for each other after being exhausted after school every day. Julianne is the most experienced and well-rounded coach I have ever had. She has played a large role in my journey to play Division 1 soccer due to her unconditional support. Even though she is not my coach anymore, I still go to her for any advice I need, whether it be for soccer, fitness or life in general."</p>&ensp;

    	<p>"Julianne has been our daughter’s club coach for the past two years. But more than that, she has worked with Zoe in her training and soccer on an individual basis. Zoe would say Julianne has been her mentor as a player and has taught her how to push herself to levels she did not know she could reach. As a parent, I can say there is a very observable difference in our daughter’s game when she is training with Julianne individually and when she is not. Zoe has worked with a number of individual coaches through the years and Julianne’s impact has far exceeded them all when it comes to our daughter’s game. I would strongly recommend her to anyone who wants to push their game to the next level."</p>&ensp;

In addition to that she was also one of the most knowledgeable coaches I've ever worked with. Her vast experience in and out of the training room and on and off the soccer field made training with her fun and difficult, because she is always coming up with new workouts that really push yourself to go farther."</p>&ensp;
